# Introduction

TickTick enables you to put JSON in bash scripts.  Yes, just encapsulate them with two back-ticks.

**Note: This is just a fun hack.** You may want to consider using mature languages like Ruby or Perl to solve actual real life problems.  Oh who am I kidding, I use whitespace and brainfuck every day.

# Usage

Proper usage (if there is such a thing), is to place the following line right after the "shbang" at the top of your script. For instance:

    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # Nuclear_meltdown_preventer.sh
    #
    # This is really important stuff. Don't edit it!
    #
    . ticktick.sh

    ..

See how that's near the tippity-top? That's where it's supposed to go. If you put it lower, all bets are off. :-(

# API

Arrays
---

A few array manipulation runtime directives are supported:
 
 * `[]` (as new Array) <pre>\`\`arr = ["foo"]\`\`</pre>
 * `[]` (to index)     <pre>echo \`\`arr[0]\`\`</pre>
 * `length`            <pre>arr_len=\`\`arr.length()\`\`; echo ${arr_len}</pre>
 * `push`              <pre>\`\`arr.push(${arr_len})\`\`</pre>
 * `pop`               <pre>echo \`\`arr.pop()\`\`</pre>
 * `shift`             <pre>echo \`\`arr.shift()\`\`</pre>
 * `delete`            <pre>echo \`\`key.value.delete()\`\`</pre>
 * `items`             <pre>for x in \`\`arr.items()\`\`; do echo "${x}"; done</pre>

Notes: 

 * These feature do not preclude having variables by those names.  You can have ``key.delete = 1`` and then ``key.delete.delete()``
 * Since TickTick is a Bash-emitting transpiler, things that don't work in bash (such as modifying [in-shell variables](https://github.com/kristopolous/TickTick/issues/5) in double quotes) don't work in TickTick.

Objects
---

 * `{}` (as new Object) <pre>\`\`obj = { "foo": "bar", "baz": "qux" }\`\`</pre>
 * `[]` (to index)      <pre>echo \`\`obj["foo"]\`\`</pre>
 * `.` (to index)       <pre>echo \`\`obj.baz\`\`</pre>

Miscellaneous
---

#### tickParse - parse things inline
 * Inline parsing: You can parse a file in with the `tickParse` routine (see the example).

#### tickVars - see the currently defined variables
 * Show all variables: You can see the current values defined in the TickTick world with the `tickVars` routine.

#### __tick_var_debug - See the interim bash code
 * Dry run (display compiled code): TickTick is a mini-compiler that emits bash. If you declare `extern __tick_var_debug=1` at the top of your code, then the code will not run but instead print what it would have run.

Bash variables ($) in JSON
---

Along with assignment operations<sup>1</sup>, and Javascript like indexing into objects and arrays.

Additionally, bash variables (eg., "$name") are preserved in the TickTick blocks.  For instance, once could do

<pre>
`` Var.Data = [] ``
`` Var.Data.push($key) ``
bashvar=`` Var.Data.pop() ``
</pre>

<sup>1</sup>Although Javascript supports $ prefixed variables, this does not.
# Examples

Inline Parsing
---

    #!/bin/bash

    . ticktick.sh

    bob=Bob

    ``
      people = {
        "HR" : [
          "Alice",
          $bob,
          "Carol"
        ],
        "Sales": {
          "Gale": { "profits" : 1000 },
          "Harry": { "profits" : 500 }
        }
      }
    ``

    function printEmployees() {
      echo
      echo "  The ``people.Engineering.length()`` Employees listed are:"

      for employee in ``people.Engineering.items()``; do
        printf "    - %s\n" "${!employee}"
      done

      echo 
    }

    echo Base Assignment
    `` people.Engineering = [ "Darren", "Edith", "Frank" ] ``
    printEmployees

    newPerson=Isaac
    echo Pushed a new element by variable, $newPerson onto the array
    `` people.Engineering.push($newPerson) ``
    printEmployees

    echo Shifted the first element off: `` people.Engineering.shift() ``
    printEmployees

    echo Popped the last value off: `` people.Engineering.pop() ``
    printEmployees

    echo Indexing an array, doing variable assignments

    person0=``people.HR[0]``
    echo $person0 ``people.HR[1]``

Using a File or cURL
---

    #!/bin/bash
    . ../ticktick.sh

    # File
    DATA=`cat data.json`
    # cURL
    #DATA=`curl http://foobar3000.com/echo/request.json`

    tickParse "$DATA"

    echo ``pathname``
    echo ``headers["user-agent"]``
